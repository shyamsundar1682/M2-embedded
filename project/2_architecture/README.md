 ## Infrared sensors
  # Infrared transmitter which acts as the source.
  # Infrared receiver which acts as the receiver.
  # Infrared sources include an IR LED and Infrared detectors include photodiodes. 
  # The energy emitted by the infrared source is reflected by an object and falls back on the infrared detector. 
  # When the light emitted by the IR LED falls on the receiver, the resistance of the photodiode falls down significantly. 
  # This photoreceiver is connected with a potentiometer to form a voltage divider circuit, which gives a variable analog output when blinking activity is detected.
