## 1.Arduino based Driver Drowsiness Detection & Alerting System

## Description
Road accidents became a matter of concern due to the huge increase in traffic. The primary cause of accidents is due to the drowsiness of drivers in the nighttime. Fatigue and drowsiness are some of the leading causes of major accidents on Highways. The only solution to this problem is detecting the drowsiness and alerting the driver.

## Abstract
 In this project, to build a Driver Drowsiness Detection and Alerting System for Drivers using Arduino Nano, Eye blink Sensor, and RF Transceiver module. The basic purpose of this system is to track the driverâ€™s eye movements using Eye blink Sensor and if the driver is feeling drowsy, then the system will trigger a warning message using a loud buzzer alert.
